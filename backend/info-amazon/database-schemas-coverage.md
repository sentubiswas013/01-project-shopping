Great question 👍 — what we’ve covered so far is already a **very comprehensive Walmart-like database schema**, but Walmart is **more than just an eCommerce site**.

Since Walmart operates **retail stores, warehouses, HR systems, finance, logistics, pharmacy, marketplace for sellers, etc.**, the database schemas span across **multiple domains**.

⚡ Next step: I can put this entire structure into either:

1. A **giant ER diagram** showing all relations (visual format), OR
2. A **SQL script with CREATE TABLE definitions** for every module.

👉 Do you want me to generate the **ER diagram (visual full Walmart database)** or the **SQL implementation**?
